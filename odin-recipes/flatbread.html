		<p class="description">Flatbread was an essential part of the Norwegian diet for a thousand years, since the time of Vikings. It used to be the daily bread for farmers and peasants during the Nordmen times. The word ‘flatbrød‘ was mentioned for the first time in the stock books from the Bergen Manor in 1519.</p>

		<ul>
			<li class="ingredient-1">750g brown flour</li>
			<li class="ingredient-2">500g fine white flour</li>
			<li class="ingredient-3">half a tablespoon of salt</li>
			<li class="ingredient-4">1 litre of sour milk</li>
			<li class="ingredient-5">barley flour for kneading (and traditional texture)</li>
		</ul>

		<div class="step-1">
			<h3 class="step">Step 1</h3>
			<p class="instructions">Mix dry ingredients together. Fold in milk. The mixture will naturally be a little wet like a paste more than a dough. It is good to let the dough stand for a while but, of course, it won’t rise.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="step-2">
			<h3 class="step">Step 2</h3>
			<p class="instructions">Sprinkle a good amount of barley flour on a clean bench and gently knead the dough to form a log. Divide the dough into workable sizes. If you are using a traditional skillet then you want about 200g of mixture to make a 60cm diameter flatbread. We divided our dough to be small enough fit into the centre of our palm. This meant when rolled out the pieces to fit into our frypan perfectly.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="step-3">
			<h3 class="step">Step 3</h3>
			<p class="instructions">Roll out a piece of dough, using more barley flour, into a very thin sheet. The thinner it is, the better. All water needs to be evaporated from the dough while in the frypan – if it is too thick the dough will burn before the water can be evaporated. Unfortunately, when the dough is so thin it is hard to pick up from the board without stretching it. We used our rolling pin, rolling up from the end, to pick up the dough and lay it on the frypan. This is when a flat stick is handy when you are making 60cm diam. flatbread.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="step-4">
			<h3 class="step">Step 4</h3>
			<p class="instructions">The frypan needs to be at medium heat because essentially all you are doing is baking out the moisture. Do not grease or use any oils in the frypan – it needs to be dry.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="step-5">
			<h3 class="step">Step 5</h3>
			<p class="instructions">Lay the rolled dough onto the pan. It will take a minute or two to harden on the bottom and then you can flip it over. If your dough becomes golden brown on both sides but the inside is still moist it means that the dough wasn’t rolled out thin enough. Don’t worry, it is not a waste – it can be finished off in the oven later.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="step-6">
			<h3 class="step">Step 6</h3>
			<p class="instructions">Take the flatbread out of the pan, you can dust off any excess barley flour on the bread with a cooking brush, and then put it on a wire rack for cooling. If there is any barley flour left in the pan, just discard it before starting the next batch.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="step-7">
			<h3 class="step">Step 7</h3>
			<p class="instructions">Then repeat for each – roll out, pan-bake, brush away and set on the rack. We used three frypans at once to speed up the cooking time because there is a lot of dough.</p>
